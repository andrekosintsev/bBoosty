                <p>Body Boost Bot. (“Body Boost Bot”, “we”, “us” or “our”) does not provide medical, fitness, or other
                    advice. You participate in exercise activities entirely at your own risk.</p>

                <p>IMPORTANT NOTICE:</p>

                <p>By downloading, accessing, or using the Application or Services (as each is defined below), you agree
                    to the terms of these Terms, which will bind you. The Terms include, in particular, the privacy
                    policy defined in Section 1 and limitations on liability in Section 5.</p>

                <p>CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP</p>

                <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern the access or use by you, an individual, from within the United
                    States and its territories and possessions, or any other country or territory worldwide, of
                    applications, websites, content, products, and services (the “Services”) made available by Body
                    Boost Bot. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES. In these Terms,
                    the words “including” and “include” mean “including, but not limited to.”

                    Your access and use of the Services constitute your agreement to be bound by these Terms, which
                    establish a contractual relationship between you and Body Boost Bot. If you do not agree to these
                    Terms, you may not access or use the Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or
                    arrangements with you. Body Boost Bot may immediately terminate these Terms or any Services with
                    respect to you or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof at
                    any time for any reason.

                    Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a particular event, activity,
                    or promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the applicable
                    Service(s). Supplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the
                    purposes of the applicable Service(s). Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the
                    event of a conflict with respect to the applicable Services.

                    Body Boost Bot may amend the Terms related to the Services from time to time. Amendments will be
                    effective upon Body Boost Bot’s posting of such updated Terms at this location or the amended
                    policies or supplemental terms on the applicable Service(s). Your continued access or use of the
                    Services after such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.

                    You agree and consent to our collection and use of personal information in connection with the
                    Services, as provided in <a href="https://kvadsoft.de/pp.html">Body Boost Bot’s Privacy Policy</a></p>

                    limitation any advice, information, nutritional recommendations, recipes, or other materials. Unless
